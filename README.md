This web app uses D3 / javascript visualization to display cartographic IP data using Datamaps using javascript event timers and data queues deployed on Heroku.

Examples of Usage:

http://vitali-honeypot.herokuapp.com/index.html?china_mode=1&org_name=[INSERT ANY COMPANY NAME]&bad_day=1

http://vitali-honeypot.herokuapp.com/index.html?org_name=[INSERT ANY COMPANY NAME]&drill_mode=1&lat=[INSERT ANY FLOAT VALUE]&lon=[INSERT ANY FLOAT VALUE]

http://vitali-honeypot.herokuapp.com/index.html?org_name=[INSERT ANY COMPANY NAME]&employee_mode=1&employee_fname=[INSERT ANY FIRST NAME]&employee_lname=[INSERT ANY LAST NAME]&lat=[INSERT ANY FLOAT VALUE]&lon=[INSERT ANY FLOAT VALUE]

Using IPAttackMapWebsite

Feel free to use the hosted version, but we've released IPew under a liberal Creative Commons license, so clone away and use as you see fit, just remember to share your creations (and code) with others.

IPAttackMapWebsite includes the following sounds:

- no sound option set - Star Wars blaster! (guess which one!)
- `tng=1` - Star Trek:TNG Photons!
- `wargames=1` - WarGames key clicks!
- `b5=1` - Babylon 5 defense grid cannons!
- `pew=1` - Somewhat disturbing human-made "pew-pew" sound
- `galaga=1` - Classic arcade sound!

To turn off sound effects (but, but, _why?_ :-), use `nofx=1`, and to randomly cycle through them all use `allfx=1`

By default, IPew will use a statistical model for choosing source countries for the attacks, but you can level the playing field and set `random_mode=1` to give all countries the same cyber-advatage.

In similar vein, and using the perpsective many prominent security vendors and pundits seem to have, you can make all cyber attacks from from China with `china_mode=1` or from North Korea with `dprk_mode=1`.


IPew's default attack timing is based on observational data from many sources, but you can make it look like the world is on the brink of cyber collapse by setting `bad_day=1`.

Finally, you can proudly display your organization's name by setting `org_name=MyOrgName` (URL encode any spaces or special characters).

### Drill Mode

We had an interesting request to be able to use IPew in a IR "drill" setting, so there's now a "drill mode" where you can specify a latitude &amp; longitude to be the destination for the attacks. Right now, all attacks go there, but we may add an option to specify a percentage of attacks that should go there. You _must_ use `drill_mode=1&lat=##.####&lon=##.####` for this to work, like: `drill_mode=1&lat=43.2672&lon=-70.8617` (which would focus all attacks near @hrbrmstr). Remember, you can specify your organization name there, too.

### Blame former employee mode

If you want to show that former employees are the problem, try out
employee_mode. You can set a first and last name for the employee and also
set a latitude and longitude.
